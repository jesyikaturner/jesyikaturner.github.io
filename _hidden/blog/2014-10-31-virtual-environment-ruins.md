#### The Story

The player wakes up in a unfamiliar place. They have to find out where they are and how what happened via exploring and solving puzzles. The planet was a natural wonderland til settlers from another planet came. They built their civilisation and made nature bend to their will. They became so advanced in their technol- ogy, they started to harvest the very life-force of the world and that’s when the planet attacked back. The life-force that they harvested corrupted the beings and transformed their bodies and wrecked their minds. The player is a researcher sent to find out what happened on the planet, but before they arrived, the planet attacked them and they awoke with amnesia.

#### Aesthetics

The buildings and trees are sharp and jagged to contrast with the softness of the grass and leaves. It’s to show how alien the buildings look compared to the natural world. There’s the theme of nature slowly overtaking technology. And how time can destroy. The colours of the environment are vibrant and very colourful but the further the player progresses the colours become very minimal and contrast-y (de-saturated dark colours with little bright colours.) The forests in the beginning are very lush and colourful which slowly lose that and become very wire-y and technological. Eventually there are barely any trees and the trees that are there are dead black sticks.

The background music is soft but bright and cheerful, with loud sound effects like birds chirping in the background. The further towards the tower the player goes, the music becomesharsh, techno with barely any sound effects. Creatures have distorted voices. The lava areas areharsh but still bright and cheerful like the forest areas.

#### The World

**The Starting Forest**

This is the area where the player wakes up in. In front of them off in the distance is a ruined building. Bits of the stone are broken away to reveal a layer of wires and strange glowing symbols. Around the player, to their left and right are pillars of differing sizes. They too are broken and crack- ing in places. To the player’s right there is another building smaller than the first but just as ruined. Between the two buildings in a broken wall. The player can hear an odd sound coming from there. If they were to walk over, they would find a weird looking creature standing in front of a tent and next to a campfire. In the big building there is a big door with a small indent shaped like a key hole to its left. Below the keyhole is an old sword. The player can use that to defeat the creature behind the wall. In the other building, it is mostly empty except for a door that looks exactly like the one in the bigger building. There is a keyhole on the left as well. Looking around to the building’s right, the player will find a shiny piece of metal, that looks like it’s part of something. If the player jumps onto the pillars, they can reach the top of the bigger building. There they will find another piece of metal, that easily slips into place with the piece they already picked up.
The player jumps down back the way they came, since they are now armed they can go and take on the creature. Once the player defeats the monster, a piece falls onto the ground. The player joins that with the combined two pieces to form a key. The player now has the choice of going through one out of the two doors.

**Forest 1**

The player walks through the door and immediately behind them, the door slams shut with a loud noise. That door cannot be opened again. The area is rather empty compared to the previous area. It’s considerably larger too. There are a number of trees but unlike the previous area, some towards the far north are strange. Their trunks are darker and dull and their leaves have glowing wires running through them. In the mid- dle of the area, there is a strange looking platform, it has some symbols on it but the player cannot in anyway interact with it. The player has only one option in this area, they have to move on past the dull trees and into the outer wasteland.

**Big Forest**

Very big and empty. There is a platforming section using giant rocks to get onto the top of a lone pillar that is overgrown and worn. If the player was entering from the forest-wasteland then it would be to the player’s left, right near the entrances to the Large Forest and the Forest - Lava.

**Small Forest**

Very forest-y. No monsters. Used as a passage way between all the areas.

**Lava**

This is the edge of the forest. The trees are lush and colourful and the grass is bright and soft looking. Then it cuts off in the distance. There is a faint bubbling sound that gets louder as the player gets closer to it. The edge leads to a sharp drop straight into lava. To the player’s right, there is some sharp rocky outcrops, that make a very dangerous set of platforms to a big ledge on the side of the huge mountain. There is a light coming from that ledge, a sign that there is something that the player needs on it. If the player manages to get to the other side, they will find a glowing orb, one side is white and the other is pitch black.

**Lava - Forest**

This is on the edge of the forest. Half is the forest and the other is a deep river of lava. Player has to jump down the side of the cliff, above the lava to get to a small cave where the player has to fight a monster to get one of the items.

**Large Forest**

Huge forest area. In the western areas there are the dull trees. It’s mostly covered in bush and tress. There are a couple of monsters roaming around. Player has to switch a button to open the gate between the big forest and forest 1.It also acti- vates the platform. The player has to go back to get a item to use in the Large forest which uncovers another item.

**Forest - Wasteland**

Some pillars here and there, mostly empty with a few trees. The ground is dull and lifeless. There are monsters roaming around (ones that look like the first one the player encountered.)

**Wasteland**

Empty except for the tower and the ruins.

**Ruins**

The item is hidden in amongst some ruins.

**Tower**

Stairs leading towards the top. The final boss sits there. Player has to fight the boss using a combination of fighting and platforming.

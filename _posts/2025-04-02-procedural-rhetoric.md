In the realm of game design and theory, the discussion around procedural rhetoric and its criticisms is both complex and thought-provoking. At the heart of this debate is a significant critique by Miguel Sicart, who in his writing "Against Procedurality," challenges the concept originally proposed by Ian Bogost. Read on as we delve into the intricacies of procedural rhetoric, Sicart's interpretations, and the broader implications on game design.

### What is Procedural Rhetoric?

Now to understand procedural rhetoric, we must first explore proceduralism, a concept that examines how arguments are embedded within the rules of a game. Proceduralism is the study of how these rules are communicated and understood by players, giving games their meaning. Ian Bogost, in his book Persuasive Games (2007), articulates that procedural rhetoric is "the practice of using processes persuasively," suggesting that the meaning of a game is derived from its rules and the player's interaction with them.

Bogost argues that games, through their simulated rules, convey values that are processed by players, filtered through their biases, and thus, create meaning. He asserts that procedural rhetoric is central to digital media's study of rhetoric, stressing that it is not merely about the formal aspects of games but includes their interactive nature, which is unique to digital mediums.

### Miguel Sicart's Critique

Sicart takes issue with procedural rhetoric, positing that it often neglects the role of play and the player's creative and performative activities. He argues that in procedural rhetoric, the game's meaning is overly confined to its rules, thus sidelining the importance of play. Sicart claims that this approach forces players to perceive the game through the designer's perspective, effectively "playing the player."

One of Sicart's main contentions is that procedural rhetoric embeds agendas within the game that are imposed on players without their awareness. He compares this to his notion of "abusive game design," which he discusses alongside Douglas Wilson in "Now Itâ€™s Personal: On Abusive Game Design." Here, Sicart and Wilson introduce a concept that challenges players' expectations, inviting them to engage with the designer's intent in a more personal dialogue.

### Reconciling the Concepts

Interestingly, Sicart's concept of abusive game design shares similarities with procedural rhetoric, leading to the question of whether Sicart's critique is truly reflective of what procedural rhetoric represents. Both concepts encourage players to explore and respond to the arguments presented by the game's mechanics. This suggests that Sicart may agree with the core ideas of procedural rhetoric, but disagrees with his interpretation of Bogost's intentions.

Moreover, Ian Bogost's concept of the "procedural enthymeme" highlights the dynamic relationship between player and procedure. This concept allows players to actively fill in missing elements, completing the game's rhetorical argument. Bogost's work acknowledges the role of the player in constructing meaning, contradicting Sicart's claims of procedural rhetoric's disregard for player agency.

### Conclusion

The critique of procedural rhetoric by Sicart underscores the complexity of interpreting game design theories. While Sicart raises valid concerns about designer control and player agency, his arguments seem to stem from a misinterpretation of Bogost's work. Abusive game design, as discussed by Sicart, resembles procedural rhetoric more closely than he acknowledges, indicating a potential agreement on fundamental principles.

In the ever-evolving field of game design, the dialogue between procedural rhetoric and its criticisms continues to enrich our understanding of how games communicate meaning, inviting designers and players alike to engage in a shared exploration of digital narratives. As this conversation unfolds, it reminds us of the diverse ways games can express ideas and create immersive experiences.

Due to a recent loss, a lonely child ventures through a bright yet melancholic neon city. Using their newfound command over air, fire, earth and water, they must solve numerous puzzles and delve deeper into the world. By the end of their journey, the child learns to move on from their grief and finds acceptance.

Developed in Unity3D, using C# during my Bachelor of Design (Games) degree. Presented at ACMI as one of my final year games.
